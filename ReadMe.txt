IMPORTANT: Read this document before you begin working with SenseiPM and Piera-1, Intelligent Particulate Sensor(IPS). 

SenseiPM is application software for testing of Piera-1. The software enables you to view plots of the number and mass concentration of different particles from 0.1um to 10um in size against time, in real-time. 
The software also contains data-logging capabilities so the data may be exported as a .csv (comma separated values) file.
The sensor system calibration feature is locked with an access password. Please contact us at info@piearsystems.com for details.

Do not connect Piera-1 to your PC before installing SenseiPM.
Please Refer to the User Manual for Piera-1 Evaluation Kit (PEK).
